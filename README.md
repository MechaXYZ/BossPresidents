# PrimePresidents
A horrendous mod for ultrakill that converts the prime souls to US presidents.
Replaces textures, voice lines, and more for both prime boss fights while leaving the gameplay otherwise vanilla.
Based on the original video by [spunklord5000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm2deBbY6yY).
